# JSON Instructions
JSONMERGE.py will merge multiple files from a directory into a singular output file containing all objects. The input directory will be ran in alphanumeric order. Before running, define the input directory and the output file name in the script.

json-splitter.py will divide large json files containing multiple objects into smaller ones at a defined object value, set in the script. Running the script will ask for the input and output files - they do not need defined in the script.
