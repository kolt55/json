# JSON Instructions
JSON Merger.py will merge multiple files from a directory into a singular output file containing all objects. The input directory will be ran in alphanumeric order. Running will start a popup to select the input directory, then a window to define the output file name.

JSON Splitter.py will divide large json files containing multiple objects into smaller ones. Non-correctly formatted files (like .jsonl) will be scanned to check for objects/lines regardless of formatting. Running the script will start a popup to select the input file, define objects per split file, and then select the output directory.
